ESP32-NMEA2000 binaries
=======================

This folder contains ready made firmware binaries of [Wellenvogel
ESP32-NMEA2000 Gateweay](https://github.com/wellenvogel/esp32-nmea2000) for
supported boards:

- Wemos D1 Mini32 [firmware](wemosd1mini32-all.bin)
- [Lolin C3 Mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/c3/c3_mini.html) [firmware](lolin32c3mini-all.bin)

The easiest way to flash a firmware binary to the board is to use a web
browser that supports serial connections (Chrome, Chromium, Edge) and [web
installer](https://www.wellenvogel.net/software/esp32/install.html)

Binaries with suffix "all" can be used for the initial flashing. Binaries
with suffix "update" can be later used to update firmware via ESP32-NMEA
Gateway's web interface on the board.
